# Control of Weapons Act 1990 Gazette Scraper

The Control of Weapons Act 1990 allows Victoria Police to designate any area that meets certain very loose conditions as a warrantless stop-n-search location, on the condition that they announce it seven days prior in a local newspaper and in a government gazette. They usually do so in the CBD and around train stations, which are major transport hubs for thousands of Victorians going about our daily lives who'd prefer not to be stopped for loooking poor or brown. Local papers are dying and somewhat inaccessible, and these aren't advertised anywhere else where people would see them - like the train station. This is incredible authoritarian over-reach and disproportionately affects the disadvantaged.

This is a small Node web scraper that will check the latest gazettes online (posted in PDFs identified only with the posting date) for announcements and report them. It is a small effort toward social empowerment against the capitalist surveillance state.

This is more meant as a base for other projects, like social media/discord bots or for integration intoactivist and abolitionist toolkits.

Idea shamelessly stolen from @vicpol_searches on twitter/X, a platform that is now very inaccessible to a lot of people.
